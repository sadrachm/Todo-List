# Todo-List
A simple app using ejs, mongodb, and express to store lists of items that the user may want. The user only needs to add their mongodb server to the app. After doing this, they will be able to use the use cases that I thought of such as Mercado, Costco, Super, and Walmart which are all for grocery shopping. Feel free to check out the live version found in my resume.  

You could add items by writing the item and pressing the plus button

User could also move items to the completed section and then completely remove them by clicking on the checkbox.

My app also counts with the ability to dynamically create webpages for other lists that the user would like to have.
